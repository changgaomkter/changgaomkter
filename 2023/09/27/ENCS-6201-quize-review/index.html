on the four attributes of modern professionals discussed in the lesson:
specialized skill, judgement, self-governance, advancing social
welfare.</h4>
<ul>
<li><dl>
<dt>The attribute of skill</dt>
<dd>
Someone <strong>spend exerl considerable effort</strong> to acquire
these skills which composed of varied and intellectually demanding
techniques and practices.
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>The attribute of judgment:</dt>
<dd>
From some specital work, which is <strong>not routine work</strong> and
<strong>cannot be mechanized</strong>, which means during the work, they
need to make some choice <strong>base on the training</strong> they
recive and experience they got during their worklife. These choices
always have direct consequences for the public.
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Self-governance</dt>
<dd>
They have the <strong>certification</strong> from <strong>self-governing
professional</strong> associations. These association
<strong>established by government</strong> to govern the action of
professionals to ensure that they <strong>practice their profession to
further public welfare</strong>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Advancing social welfare</dt>
<dd>
They will consider to <strong>improve the welfare of the
public</strong>. For example, consider the effect that bad construction
in a bridge could have on the general population that relies on the
bridge to meet their transportation needs.

<h4
id="why-is-it-impossible-for-individuals-to-become-engineers-simply-by-working-as-apprentices-for-years">Why
is it impossible for individuals to become engineers simply by working
as apprentices for years?</h4>
<p>A key aspect of the nature of skill that professionals possess is
that it is composed of <strong>varied</strong> and
<strong>intellectually</strong> demanding techniques and practices, thus
requires individuals to <strong>exert considerable effort</strong> in
acquiring them. In order to acquire these skills individuals are
required to undergo an extensive and formal education usually at the
university level. This is so because many of the techniques
<strong>require a base of scientific</strong>,
<strong>technological</strong> or <strong>mathematical</strong>
<strong>education</strong> that can <strong>only</strong> be gained from
university based education.</p>
<h4
id="what-benefits-arise-from-having-professionals-form-self-regulating-organisations">What
benefits arise from having professionals form self-regulating
organisations</h4>
<p>They can ensure engineers practice their profession to further public
welfare.</p>
<h4
id="what-main-differences-exist-between-the-work-and-responsibilities-of-an-independent-professional-and-an-employed-professional">What
main differences exist between the work and responsibilities of an
independent professional and an employed professional?</h4>
<ul>
<li><dl>
<dt>Independent professions</dt>
<dd>
work <strong>independently</strong> and <strong>own paid
directly</strong> by the <strong>client</strong> for the service
provided by the professional. They have much <strong>greater
autonomy</strong>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Employed professionals</dt>
<dd>
Hired by a <strong>company</strong> or organization. In return for a
<strong>monthly salary</strong>. They have much <strong>less
autonom</strong>y.
</dd>
</dl></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-professional-licensing">What is the
purpose of professional licensing?</h4>
<p>Government can <strong>gover</strong> the <strong>behavior of
engineers</strong>. <strong>Ensure</strong> that professions are
organized to be <strong>accountable</strong> to
<strong>society</strong>. Professional associations composed of
professionals practicing the same profession are a key aspect of the
<strong>linkage between professionals and society</strong>.</p>
<h4
id="why-can-it-be-said-that-all-professions-are-moral-enterprises">Why
can it be said that all professions are “moral enterprises”?</h4>
<p>Although professions are organized around technical practices and
actions, the actions of individuals are <strong>not just
limited</strong> to technical principles but involve
<strong>significant</strong> <strong>moral content</strong>. In other
words, the choices that professionals have to make in their work are
<strong>not just</strong> about <strong>technical aspects</strong>, but
<strong>have moral</strong> and <strong>ethical</strong> dimensionse.
<strong>Thus</strong>, the objective of a professional system is to
recognize the moral and ethical nature of professional work and create
conditions, whereby member professionals will be guided to make ethical
choices that work towards the benefit of society.</p>
<h4
id="what-is-the-danger-of-mixing-professional-and-personal-values">What
is the danger of mixing professional and personal values?</h4>
<p>Mixing professional and personal values is a tricky thing, and should
<strong>require judgment on the part of the professional</strong>. Some
level of mixing is considered OK, but in other circumstances, mixing
personal and professional values <strong>would be considered a “conflict
of interest”</strong> and should be avoided. For example, wearing a
<strong>religious symbol</strong> is not usually considered in
appropriate display of personal values, but giving jobs to people of the

<p>The work of professional associations is strengthened by <strong>the
power of a law passed</strong> by the <strong>respective provincial

is the professional system for engineers in Quebec and the other
provinces considered “closed”?</h4>
<p>In order to practice most professions in Canada, an individual
<strong>has to become a member of the corresponding professional
association.</strong> A person, who practices the profession
<strong>without</strong> an explicit license, is considered to be
practicing the profession illegally and could <strong>face
legal</strong> action.</p>

can the professional system in Québec prior to the 1970s be
characterized? Which challenges did this present in terms of
accountability?</h4>
<p>Prior to 1970, the professional system in Québec could be
<strong>characterized</strong> by the <strong>existence of weak social
contracts</strong> . In other words, the professional system did
<strong>little</strong> to be <strong>explicitly</strong> accountable to
society . This <strong>lack of direct accountability</strong> was the
product of <strong>non-standardized professional associations</strong> ,
whose mandates were not uniform across the province.</p>
<p>Another fact was the acceptance of the <strong>“liberal
professional”</strong> . A liberal professional operated with limited
oversight and was independent to conduct their professional practice
.</p>
<p>A related aspect was the <strong>absence of a strong,</strong>
<strong>legally</strong> binding code that governed the conduct of
individual professionals. A combination of these three factors resulted
in the weak social accountability of the professional system.</p>

The Professional Code provides the <strong>legal basis</strong> for the
existence and operation of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec (OIQ),
which is the professional order responsible for regulating the
engineering profession in Quebec. It outlines the general principles of
professional practice, including ethics, discipline, and the protection
of the public interest.<br />
</li>
<li>The Engineers Act (fields of practice, titles etc.)<br />
is the <strong>legal basis</strong> for the <strong>operation of the

of an engineer. The field of practice includes the kind of work that
requires an engineer and the kinds of acts that counters engineering
practice, <strong>including consultation, measurement, design, drawing
and inspection.</strong><br />
</li>
<li>The Code of Ethics of Engineers<br />
This code <strong>outlines</strong> the ethical principles and standards
that engineers <strong>must follow in their work</strong>, including
<strong>obligations</strong> related to public safety, confidentiality,
conflicts of interest, and honesty. It s<strong>erves as a
guide</strong> for ethical behavior and provides a basis for the OIQ to
enforce disciplinary actions in cases of ethical violations by its
members.<br />
</li>
<li>Bill 101<br />
While Bill 101 is not specific to the engineering profession, it may
have implications for <strong>language requirements</strong> and

<h3 id="lesson-3">Lesson 3</h3>
<h4 id="what-is-ethics">What is ethics?</h4>
<p>It is <strong>a branch of the discipline of philosophy</strong>, is
the <strong>systematic analysis</strong> of <strong>behavioral
choices</strong> that humans or societies face. it is a way of analyzing
and thinking about choices. But ethics <strong>differs from decision
tools</strong>, because it helps humans to <strong>reflect on questions
of right or wrong, of obligations and rights, or whether social and
political goals are being met</strong>. Now these kinds of decisions
tend to be very subjective and dependent on the values or world view of
the person making the decision. Ethics thus is closely related to
values. Values are beliefs or worldviews that define individuals.</p>
<h4 id="why-do-we-need-ethics">Why do we need ethics?</h4>
<p>A simple answer is that ethics are <strong>needed to help humans make
choices</strong>. It helps to have a <strong>mechanism</strong> that can
guide how we think, reflect and then justify the choice we make. Why do
we need a mechanism to think about choices? This is because choices
provide alternative courses of action that lead to different
consequences and to different personalities that individuals have. if
you are facing an important professional decision that can have
important consequences on your career, the future of your company and
your family life, you need a systematic method to help you think about
the choice and then justify your decision. This is where ethics comes
in. Ethics provides a means to rationally reason your choices.</p>
<p>There is another important reason for relying on ethics to make vital
decisions because it allows us to avoid two pitfalls that many of us
find ourselves in when making a decision.</p>
<h4
id="what-are-the-pitfalls-of-absolutism-and-relativism-and-how-can-a-structured-and-reflective-approach-to-ethics-avoid-these">What
are the pitfalls of “absolutism” and “relativism,” and how can a
structured and reflective approach to ethics avoid these?</h4>
<p><strong>One pitfall</strong> is the belief in
<strong>absolutism</strong> that means the irrespective of
<strong>circumstances</strong>, my decision never changes because my
morals are absolute and <strong>always true</strong>. A good example of
<strong>absolutism</strong> is when we make the decision to punish a
person because they lied since it is always wrong to tell a lie,
irrespective of whether the lie was told for self-interest or to protect
someone else.</p>
<p><strong>A second pitfall</strong> is the belief in
<strong>relativism</strong> that suggests that one can never make a
decision that is ok for everyone because all decisions are
<strong>subjective</strong> and so <strong>no one guideline is valid for
everyone</strong>. A good example of relativism is when you suggest that
it is ok to hurt animals because in my community we believe it is an
accepted thing to do. Ethical thinking and reasoning provides a way of
thinking that can avoid these pitfalls.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-morals-and-ethics">What is the
difference between morals and ethics?</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ethics</strong></p>
<p>Broadly <strong>ethics</strong> is an understanding of the
philosophical basis for making moral choices. It allow indivual to make
choices in an objective fashion. <strong>But</strong> objectivity of
ethical analysis is always qualified by the relevant circumstance that
influence the decision</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Morals</strong><br />
It is <strong>closely</strong> related to <strong>personal
opinion</strong>. Because it is not through a process of reflection but
through a process of classification of right and wrong acts that are
<strong>dependent on cultural</strong>.<br />
It is from <strong>place to place</strong>, maybe some behavior is
immoral in one region but will be moral in other region.<br />

<p>A good example of the code of ethics is the OIQ Code of Ethics for
Engineers. The National Assembly of Québec required engineers to adopt a
code that would establish the rules of conduct for professional
practice. The code of ethics is a mandatory regulation for engineers.
<strong>The code specifies that engineers have some required duties and
obligations towards public, clients, including employers, profession of
engineering.</strong> Failure of an engineer to comply with these duties
and obligations could result in legal penalties.</p>

<h4 id="ethical-reasoning">Ethical Reasoning</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethical Reasoning</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reflecting on Choices</li>
</ol>
<p>In reflecting on choices, a key point to bear in mind is that ethics
provides a means to justify in a rational manner, the actions we take in
a professional (or personal) context.</p>
<p>the ethical rule to “treat yourself the same way as others” is itself
based on the general ethical theory called Deontological Theory. We will
talk about Deontological Theory more in this same module, but this
theory basically suggests that an action is only as valid as the means
adopted to accomplish the action. If the means are not good, then the
action that comes about is not ethically good.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Analyzing Choices</li>
</ol>
<p>From this analysis, you should be able to present a clear reason to
support the decision you make. It is this clear justification that
demonstrates to your colleagues, your company, and your clients that you
have thought through the decision very carefully and then arrived at the
choice</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Making the choice</li>
</ol>
<p>Any unethical actions could undermine your reputation and severely
damage your career and your personal life. Thus, it is important to take
professional decisions very seriously. Ethical reasoning provides a
means to do just that.</p>
<h4 id="ethical-theories">Ethical Theories</h4>
<p>Any human behavior has three aspects that include agent, action, and
result.</p>
<p>Agent focuses on the person who acts. The action focuses on the
nature of the action, while the result focuses on the consequence of the
action<br />
1. Agent</p>
<p><code>Virtue Theory</code><br />
Commonly referred to as Aristotle's Virtue Theory suggests that a better
guide to ethical action is the character of the person performing
it.<br />
The important question to ask oneself when facing a decision is what
kind of a person will I become if I make this decision?<br />
Will I be virtuous or not in making the decision? Character and virtue
of model persons are the immediate guides to decide what decision to
make.<br />
Another aspect of virtue theory is that it suggests that virtue is best
achieved through moderation by avoiding extreme choices, following the
golden mean, and avoiding extremes of action is a way to make a virtuous
decision</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Action <code>Deontological Theory</code><br />
Deontological Theory focuses on the action itself in order to decide the
ethical nature of an action.<br />
Actions are only <strong>as ethical as</strong> the nature of the action
chosen. The <strong>ends or consequences</strong> do
<strong>not</strong> justify the means chosen to accomplish them.<br />
<strong>However good the consequences may be</strong>,
<strong>if</strong> the actions are <strong>wrong</strong>, they
<strong>do not</strong> justify the action.<br />
A good example of Deontological Theory is <strong>Immanuel Kant's Duty
Ethics.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><code>Duty ethics.</code><br />
Duty ethics argues that moral actions are those that are governed by
following one's fundamental duties. In other words, those duties that
are generated by one's conscience.<br />
<strong>Immanuel Kant</strong> suggested that we should
<strong>follow</strong> this clear command of our
<strong>conscience</strong> <strong>only</strong> if those actions
<strong>follow universal principles</strong><br />
There are some problems associated with the conscience focus of this
theory. By focusing on the individual conscience this theory does not
develop a notion of a good for society.<br />
So, while an action may be good for an individual's conscience, it may
conflict with group interests.<br />
In such a situation duty theory does not provide any useful guides.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Result<br />
<code>Consequentialism</code><br />
is the ethical theory that suggests that the ethical content of an
action depends on the consequences produced by that action.<br />
If you want to decide on an action, you need to look at the hypothetical
results that will arise from the choices faced in the action.<br />
An important problem is that all good or bad consequences of an action
may not be immediately knowable at the time of making the
decision.<br />
The choice is often made without knowing all the consequences of an
action.<br />
Furthermore, there is the difficulty in characterizing what is good or
bad in a situation. An example of consequentialist theory is
<strong>John Stuart Mill's Utilitarian Theory.</strong><br />
<strong>Utilitarianism</strong> defines an ethical choice as one that
produces the maximum benefit for the greatest number of people. The
maximum benefit is understood here as the number of people
affected.<br />
A near benefit is more important than a distant benefit. If a decision
offers the maximum benefit, then that decision is the most ethical
decision. A good example of <strong>utilitarian</strong> thinking is
<strong>cost-benefit analysis</strong>, where a decision is
<strong>made</strong> by <strong>weighing</strong> the
<strong>costs</strong> and <strong>benefits</strong>
<strong>associated</strong> with the decision and choosing the decision
that offers the <strong>highest ratio</strong> of
<strong>benefit</strong> to cost.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lesson-5">Lesson 5</h3>
<h4 id="types-of-professional-relationships">Types of Professional
Relationships</h4>
<p>A professional relationship is defined as the relation between a
professional and a client.</p>
<p>two models are prevalent, an ideal type model and an invisible client
model.</p>
<h5 id="ideal-model">Ideal Model</h5>
<p>It is a model of professional relationship where the professional
provides their skill and judgment directly to the client.</p>
<p>In this model, the client interacts with the professional alone, and
therefore the need for professional’s ethics and competence is
exceptionally high.</p>
<h5 id="invisible-client-model">Invisible Client Model</h5>
<p>This is another model of professional relationship that is common
when professionals are employed to provide services within an
organizational setting like a company</p>
<p>The professional does not usually interact directly with the client
but has to follow the directions of the employer in order to satisfy the
needs of the client</p>
<p>Some key aspects are that the professional is far less autonomous
than the ideal type model because their actions are governed on a daily
basis by the organization where they work.</p>
<h4 id="organizational-behaviour">Organizational Behaviour</h4>
<p>Organizational behavior can be simply defined as the study of what
people think, feel, and do, in and around organizations</p>
<p>Accordingly, organizational behavior can be differentiated into three
kinds of influences, individual influences, group influences, and
organizational level influences.</p>
<h5 id="individual-influences">Individual Influences</h5>
<p>Individual influences on a person's behavior in an organization can
be differentiated into four: motivation, role perception, ability, and
situational factors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Motivation could be defined as the force within a person that affects
their direction, intensity, or persistence of voluntary behavior.
Motivation drives behavior. It is the force behind an individual's
decision to commit or not commit certain acts or behaviors。</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role Perception</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Roles are positions that people occupy within organizations. These
positions come with specific tasks, and associated duties and
consequences for which we are accountable when we occupy these
positions. Roles help define the behaviors we should exhibit and those
we should not when we do an assigned task. Roles are important because
they help us communicate responsibilities associated with a particular
position and they set expectations for appropriate responses to or from
others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ability</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ability refers to the natural aptitude and/or learned capabilities
that individuals possess to accomplish assigned tasks. Those with a
natural ability to perform an assigned task often show a higher comfort
level with regards to accomplishing tasks and this affects how they
respond and behave with other co-workers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Situational Factors</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Situational factors are factors that can be either internal or
external to the organization that affect how individuals function within
the organization. Internal factors could include time, budget, work
facilities, etc. These factors influence how an individual does their
work and so their behavior in the organization. Similarly, external
factors such as the current economic situation or consumer preferences
affect the expectations from individuals and therefore, influences their
behavioral responses.</p>
<h5 id="group-influences">Group Influences</h5>
<p>Three aspects influence behavior while working in groups, leadership,
power and influence, and team dynamics</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Leadership is the process of guiding and directing the behavior of
people in the work environment. It is important to distinguish between
the leader and the manager. While a leader is an advocate for change and
new approaches to problem solving, a manager is an advocate for
stability and the status quo. Leadership is of two kinds: formal and
informal. Formal leadership is when the organization bestows the
authority to a person to guide and direct a group. Informal leadership
is accorded unofficially when a person is granted the power to guide by
others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power and Influence</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Power is the ability to influence someone else's behavior, while
influence is the process of affecting the thoughts and behavior of
another person. In an organization, power and influence is frequently
exercised to get other people to do something that is in the interests
of the organization or in the interests of a person. Authority is the
right granted by the organization to influence another person. Another
common means of influencing other people is through politics. Politics
is especially useful in order to influence people who have authority
over others. Politics is the use of power and influence to further
personal interest, some are acceptable, while others are not.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team Dynamics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A team can be defined as a group of people with complimentary skills
who are committed to a common mission, performance goals, and approach
for which they hold themselves mutually accountable. The structure of
teams exert important influences on how individuals behave when working
in them. For example, structural aspects of teams such as goals and
objectives, operational guidelines, assessment measures, and role
distribution for team leaders and members, play an important role in
influencing behavior.</p>
<h5 id="organizational-influences">Organizational Influences</h5>
<p>Organizational level influences on behavior can happen through two
aspects: organizational structure, and organizational culture.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizational Structure</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Organizational structure could be defined as the division of labor
and patterns of coordination, communication, workflow, and formal power,
that direct organizational activities. A common representation of
organizational structure is the organizational chart that conveys in a
visual diagram the relations between different roles people occupy in an
organization. Several factors differentiate the structure of an
organization. These include the span of control, which refers to the
number of people who report to any person, the degree of centralization,
decentralization, or the number of people with decision making authority
in an organization, and the degree of formalization, or the
standardization of rules and procedures in an organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Organizational Structure</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Differences in organizational structures reflect how structures are
departmentalized. In other words, it specifies how employees and their
activities are grouped together. It also establishes a chain for the
flow of commands and for the coordination of information. Organizational
and management studies distinguish at least five major types of
organizational structures.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Line Organization</li>
</ol>
<p>The line organization is the most hierarchical structure. The only
departments in the organization are those that accomplish the mission of
the organization. There are only direct vertical relationships among the
different operations or line departments within a firm. There is little
horizontal communication across different departments.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Line &amp; Staff Organization</li>
</ol>
<p>This structure creates a parallel chain of line and staff. The staff
provides advisory or support role to the line departments. A good
example is that accounting office that reports to the president, it also
provides financial advice and support to the production and marketing
departments.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Functional Organization</li>
</ol>
<p>This organizational structure has a type of departmentalization that
organizes employees around specific knowledge or resources. Projects are
divided into segments and assigned to relevant functional areas and/or
groups within functional areas. A disadvantage of this organizational
structure is that employees develop a narrow understanding of business
and this results in poor coordination across different functions.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Divisional Organization</li>
</ol>
<p>In this type of organizational structure, employees are grouped
according to the primary source of environmental uncertainty, depending
upon whether the company is selling in multiple places, or to different
clients, or if different products are sold across a country. In other
words, the structure is grouped around geographic areas, products, or
clients. The problem with this structure is that it results in the
duplication of structure, personnel and resources.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Matrix Organization</li>
</ol>
<p>A matrix organization tries to combine the qualities of a functional
and divisional organizational structure. In a matrix organization,
employees are assigned to cross functional teams working on specific
projects. They also belong to permanent functional units from where they
are distributed to projects. This allows for optimum use of resources
and expertise. A disadvantage of this structure is that employees are
accountable to two managers and this can create ambiguity and
conflict.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizational Culture</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Organizational culture is a set of values and assumptions shared
within an organization. While values reflect the belief about what
should be or should not be assumptions, our deeply held beliefs and
mental models that guide behavior and tell members how to think about
things. Organizational culture is made visible through practices symbols
and physical structures of the organization. In other words, through
actions that everyone in an organization does without thinking like for
example, wishing the boss “Good Morning” our practices in symbols of
organizational culture. Similarly, physical structures like the nature
of rooms, organization of office space, and decoration on the walls, all
reveal the culture of an organization.</p>
<h4
id="influences-on-professional-loyalty-in-an-organization">Influences on
Professional Loyalty in an Organization</h4>
<p>When professionals work within an organizational setting their
behavior is influenced by individual, group, and organizational
influences. Professional behavior is particularly susceptible to group
and organizational influences. A powerful group influence on
professional behavior is the nature of leadership and the style of
leadership that is prevalent within the organization. Another important
influence is the structure of the organization. Let us look at the
influence of each of these forces on professional behavior.</p>
<h5 id="leadership-style">Leadership Style</h5>
<p>Leadership, as we have noted, is related to guiding and directing the
behavior of people in the workplace. The objective of this guiding
behavior is to deliberately shape the outcomes of how co-workers perform
at tasks and duties with the intention of achieving organizational
goals. Different leaders and managers possess different styles for
managing their subordinates. Leadership styles can be of the following
types.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Autocratic style – leaders adopt directive or controlling actions to
enforce rules and activities. This style is particularly effective for
tasks that need to be finished urgently. However, long-term reliance on
this style can affect the judgment and autonomy of professionals.<br />
</li>
<li>Democratic style – leaders take collaborative, responsive, and
interactive actions with followers. This democratic style allows for the
evolution of mutual respect between professionals and co-workers. There
is far less pressure to be influenced by organizational
priorities.<br />
</li>
<li>Laissez-faire style – leader who fails to take responsibility of
position. As a result, subordinates may have greater freedom, but there
is little evolution of a coherent mission in the organization. In the
short-term, professionals may face less pressures, but in the long-run
will feel under-valued and frustrated.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="organizational-structure">Organizational Structure</h5>
<p>Organizational structure of an organization also plays a vital role
in shaping the behavior of professionals. This is because the nature of
the structure shapes different facets of how individuals are managed,
how communication flows in the organization, and how decisions are made.
Some pressures that an organizational structure exerts on the individual
professional are the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Success within an organization arises from not just professional
success, but also from knowledge of how the organization is structured.
The knowledge of how the organization is structured is crucial for a
professional to understand how information and commands flow in an
organization.</li>
<li>Another important aspect of organizational structure that influences
a professional is the decision-making process. Who makes decisions, and
how formalized decision-making is in the organization affects how
professionals can contribute to decisions.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lesson-6">Lesson 6</h3>
<h4 id="introduction-to-professional-values-and-relations">Introduction
to Professional Values and Relations</h4>
<p>In this class we will consider four values that are key to developing
an ethical professional relationship in your careers, especially in the
Quebec context. These values are trust, loyalty, dignity, and
honesty.</p>
<h4 id="trust">Trust</h4>
<p>What is trust? It is a key value underlying a professional
relationship. Trust is the ability to rely confidently on people,
objects or circumstances. If we have trust in someone or something, we
are more likely to rely on them while making a decision to do something.
For example, since we trust our computer to process our work and store
it reliably, we have come to rely on them. This process of reliance
however, introduces risk in a relationship of trust.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-trust-important">Why is Trust Important?</h4>
<p>Why is trust important to a professional relationship? Trust is
important for a professional relationship because in a legal sense
without trust, there can be no professional relationship. In legal
terms, a professional relationship is a fiduciary relationship and a
professional is a fiduciary. A fiduciary is a person in whom another has
placed utmost trust and confidence to manage their property or money. In
personal lives, a good example of a fiduciary relationship is the
relation between a parent and a child where the parent is a fiduciary. A
fiduciary relationship, therefore, is one where the fiduciary has the
obligation to act for the benefit of another. Violating trust violates
the nature of the relationship.</p>
<h4 id="trust-building-obligations">Trust Building Obligations</h4>
<p>Trust building obligations. For an engineer practicing in Quebec, the
code of ethics for engineers directs engineers to create a bond of trust
between the professional and the client or employer. A bond of trust
suggests that the professional relationship between a professional
engineer and the client or employer should be based on trust.</p>
<p>According to the code of ethics, it is a binding obligation for all
engineers to create a bond of trust. In order to build the bond of
trust, the engineer is expected to take several measures. These measures
include disclosure of limits, integrity, and transparency, availability
and diligence, independence and impartiality, confidentiality, and fees.
While these measures are mandated for all engineers, they're more
relevant for the independent engineer who practices alone, primarily
because many of these measures are inculcated by organizational policies
for engineers employed in an organization. Each of these aspects of
trust building is described in detail below.</p>
<h4 id="disclosure-of-limits">Disclosure of Limits</h4>
<p>Disclosure of limits. Full disclosure to the client of the abilities
and limitations of an engineer is a basic building block for trust by
responsibly disclosing the ability of the engineer in terms of material
resources, equipment, finances, space, or intellectual resources, people
skills, or time resources. The engineer is sending a clear message to
the client about their abilities, that the client does not overestimate
the ability of the engineer to deliver. While disclosing resources it is
important for the engineer to do so in a responsible fashion so that the
engineer is not seen to be reckless, overestimates their abilities, or a
naysayer, underestimates their abilities.</p>
<h4 id="integrity-transparency">Integrity &amp; Transparency</h4>
<p>Integrity and transparency. An engineer must act in a fashion that
demonstrates integrity and transparency in their professional work.</p>
<p>One means of demonstrating integrity and transparency is to inform
the client at the beginning of the terms of agreement in writing.
Subsequently, the engineer should ensure a document trail in all
interactions between engineer and client. By documenting all
interactions, the engineer sends a clear message that they are acting in
a transparent fashion.</p>
<p>Integrity and transparency can be fostered by furnishing explanations
as in when requested by the client. When these explanations are
provided, it is important to ensure that contradictory explanations are
not provided. Furthermore, when the client ignores the engineer's
advice, the engineer must inform the client in writing of the
consequences for ignoring their advice.</p>
<h4 id="availability-diligence">Availability &amp; Diligence</h4>
<p>Availability and diligence. The engineer must demonstrate reasonable
availability and diligence in professional practice. A good way of
demonstrating this is by making known the engineer's working hours and
contacts and then ensuring the client can reach the engineer during
these hours.</p>
<p>Similarly, the engineer must give advance notice if for some reason
they wish to cease working for the client. The engineer can only cease
to work for the client for some clearly defined grounds. These grounds
are if the work involves illegal or fraudulent acts, if the client
ignores the engineer's advice, and if there is a conflict of interest.
We will describe what is meant by conflict of interest later.</p>
<h4 id="independence-impartiality">Independence &amp; Impartiality</h4>
<p>Independence and impartiality. It is of utmost importance that the
engineer ensure that their professional independence and impartiality is
maintained at all costs. In order to do so, the engineer is required to
take precautions to safeguard their independence and impartiality. One
key fashion to do so is to avoid situations of conflict of interest.
Another measure is to subordinate one's personal interest to the
interest of the client.</p>
<p>Another means of ensuring impartiality is to ensure that the engineer
does not receive fees for services provided from anyone else other than
the client or the clients representative. These measures may seem minor
but are important to ensure that the engineer is not just impartial and
independent in actions, but is also perceived to be so.</p>
<h4 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h4>
<p>Confidentiality. It is of utmost importance that the engineer
safeguard the confidentiality of the information provided by the client.
In doing so, the engineer needs to remember that they are not authorized
to share any of the client’s information unless explicitly released from
secrecy by the client or requested to do so by a court of law.</p>
<p>In addition to not releasing the information engineer is expected to
not use the client's information in a way that will prejudice the client
or accept another mandate that will involve disclosing a previous
client’s information.</p>
<h4 id="fees">Fees</h4>
<p>Fees. An engineer is expected to charge fair and reasonable fees that
correspond to the services rendered. The expectation is that neither
will an engineer overcharge the client, nor will the engineer provide
services for free. In fact, the engineer is forbidden from providing
services for free. Accordingly, the client should be given a written
explanation for the fees that were charged.</p>
<h4 id="conflict-of-interest">Conflict of Interest</h4>
<p>Conflict of interest. As we had mentioned earlier, a professional
relationship with a client or employer is considered a fiduciary
relationship. Such a relationship creates a legal obligation for the
professional to always act in the positive interests of the client.</p>
<p>One of the factors that can compromise the fiduciary nature of this
relationship is conflict of interest. Conflict of interest can be
defined as the existence of a parallel interest that could threaten or
appear to threaten the exercise of good judgment of the typical
professional.</p>
<p>A key point is that conflicts of interest affect the professional
interest in judgment of a professional.</p>
<p>Another vital aspect of a conflict of interest is that perception is
very important. As a professional, you may be confident that in a
particular situation, you have not acted in conflict of interest, or
that your judgment has not been compromised. But if popular perception
is that a typical professional’s judgment could be affected in these
circumstances, then you are in conflict of interest, irrespective of
your convictions.</p>
<p>Conflicts of interest come in several types. The most common type is
when professionals receive gifts, bribes or kickbacks in order to
influence their decision.</p>
<p>Another type of conflict of interest is insider information for
friends or relatives. For example, if you are hiring someone for the
company and your brother has applied for the job, this situation exposes
you to conflict of interest.</p>
<p>A third type of conflict of interest is the existence of interest in
other companies. An example of this would be when you as a professional
are working as a designer for one firm, while you have investment
interests in a competing firm. As a professional, avoid putting yourself
in conflict of interest situations. If it is unavoidable, a
professional’s only safeguard is full disclosure of conflict of interest
so that the conflict of interest stands revealed.</p>
<h4 id="loyalty">Loyalty</h4>
<p>Loyalty. loyalty is usually described as an attitude or character
that is demonstrated by a person through their actions. A clear
demonstration of loyalty is when a person puts the interests of a person
or institution, such as a family, community or nation before personal
interests, even when such an action exposes the person to risk.</p>
<p>In thinking about loyalty in the professional sphere, it is important
to distinguish between two kinds of loyalty, attitude loyalty and agency
loyalty.</p>
<p>Attitude loyalty is loyalty that is considered an attitude or
sentiment of a person. It is an emotional or identity response that
arises from group affiliation. A display of attitude loyalty is
considered a desirable quality, but usually not an obligation for
members.</p>
<p>Another type of loyalty is agency loyalty that arises from fulfilling
contractual duties. For example, if you are hired to perform a task in
an organization, you are required to be a loyal agent as long as you
work for the organization. Agency loyalty is a mandatory obligation that
is fulfilled by obeying legitimate authority of colleagues and superiors
and by following all policies and norms of the organization you work
for.</p>
<h4 id="assessing-the-moral-status-of-loyalty">Assessing the Moral
Status of Loyalty</h4>
<p>Assessing the moral status of loyalty. While loyalty is usually
considered a positive sentiment in personal lives, the requirement of
loyalty in professional lives needs careful evaluation. A sentimental
consideration is unsuitable in the professional context. This is because
an emotional form of loyalty requires unquestioned or absolute loyalty.
Such an absolute response towards superiors or the organization would
limit the possibility for an individual to develop an appropriate
ethical response to forms of immoral action by the organization
superiors or colleagues.</p>
<p>Instead, loyalty in the professional context requires use of judgment
to develop and practice loyalty. It requires individuals to think
carefully about what loyalty means and how much is owed in the
professional context.</p>
<p>A good strategy is to critically evaluate the organization and how it
treats employees in order to assess the nature of loyalty that is owed
by an employee. It is important to think through questions like do I
feel a sense of gratitude towards my employer? Is there a sense of
fairness in the workplace? Is this organization responsive to the needs
and concerns of its employees? Does this organization offer rewards and
acknowledgments? Am I proud of this organization?</p>
<h4 id="dignity">Dignity</h4>
<p>Professional dignity. Dignity is a feeling of respect or esteem that
an individual holds themselves in. Certain actions can cause damage to
the positive sense of esteem about a person. Causing damage to the
positive feeling of esteem of a person could cause grievous
psychological harm to the individual.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, professional dignity is considered a positive
sense of esteem that the profession has collectively acquired as a
result of positive contributions the profession makes to society. But
this dignity or honorable reputation of the profession is fragile and
can easily be compromised. Any member of the profession through their
irresponsible actions can cause damage to the dignity of the
profession.</p>
<p>In Quebec, it is a mandatory duty of each individual engineer to
safeguard the dignity of the profession. This duty is prescribed in the
province’s professional code and in the code of ethics for
engineers.</p>
<h4 id="honesty">Honesty</h4>
<p>Honesty. Honesty is a moral virtue that is widely accepted, but not
very well understood. Primarily because it is a practice relevant to
many different facets of our existence in society.</p>
<p>In such a situation, since we could encounter honesty in so many
spheres of our life, we do not often realize that we have been honest or
dishonest in a particular aspect. In the personal sphere. Honesty can be
interpreted as truth telling. So an honest person is one who can be
relied on to tell the truth irrespective of circumstances. But in the
professional context, honesty is not limited to just speaking the truth.
It also implies representing oneself, our actions and our views openly
and truthfully.</p>
<p>So in addition to honesty being an act of truth telling, it also
means that to be honest in the workplace implies the act of following
scientific facts, the act of avoiding inappropriate means and the act of
showing respect to colleagues in a professional relationship.</p>
<p>The difference between honesty as truth telling and honesty as
correct representation of actions can be distinguished by the difference
between the act of commission and the act of omission. While telling a
deliberate lie would be an act of commission on the part of the person
speaking a lie. On the other hand, we lie by omission when we neglect to
mention a relevant event, information or circumstance to a person. Thus,
honest representation requires us to avoid both acts of commission and
omission.</p>
<h4 id="duty-to-be-honest">Duty to be Honest</h4>
<p>Duty to be honest. Although not mentioned separately as a mandatory
duty for engineers, the duty to be honest, has considerable overlap with
the trust building obligations of engineers towards clients or employers
and with their duty towards humanity.</p>
<p>But a few obligations indicate the duty to be honest. These are, the
engineer shall express their opinion on matters dealing with engineering
only if such opinion is based on sufficient knowledge and honest
convictions. An engineer must be impartial in their relations between
client and contractor suppliers, etc. An engineer must safeguard their
independence at all times by avoiding situations of conflict of
interest.</p>
<h4 id="whistleblowing">Whistleblowing</h4>
<p>Whistleblowing. Whistleblowing is an act that follows directly from
the requirement of engineers to be honest and transparent in their
actions and views. It has been defined as an act by an employee of
informing the public or higher management of unethical or illegal
behavior by an employer or supervisor.</p>
<p>As an engineer, if you come to know of the commission of unethical or
illegal actions in the workplace, your duty to be honest as an engineer
demands that you approach either the supervisor or the public to reveal
the existence of such actions. Not doing so would mean you have engaged
in an act of omission.</p>
<p>Whistleblowing can be categorized into two types, internal or
external, depending upon whether the whistle is blown inside or outside
the organization. Internal whistleblowing would mean going over the head
of an immediate supervisor, who may be engaged in unethical action to a
higher level of management. External whistleblowing would mean going
outside the company and report unethical or illegal actions to the media
or to law enforcement agencies directly. In the context of professional
engineering in Quebec, there are well instituted procedures for
whistleblowing. At the first level, when you encounter an illegal or
unethical action in your workplace, your action should be to bring it to
the attention of the company, first, verbally and then failing which
clearly indicate in writing to the company the consequences that may
result from ignoring your advice. If after this, there is no
satisfactory resolution, as an engineer, your option, especially when
certain works are a danger to public safety must be to notify the order.
For an engineer in Quebec going public would imply approaching the OIQ
rather than going to the media.</p>
<h4 id="trust-building-and-conflict-of-interest">Trust Building and
Conflict of Interest</h4>
<h5 id="trust-building-obligations-1">Trust-building Obligations</h5>
<p>For an engineer practicing in Québec, the Code of Ethics for
Engineers directs engineers to create a bond of trust between the
professional and the client (or employer). A bond of trust suggests that
the professional relationship between a professional engineer and the
client or employer should be based on trust. According to the code of
ethics, it is a binding obligation for all engineers to create a bond of
trust. In order to build the bond of trust, the engineer is expected to
take several measures. These measures include – disclosure of limits,
integrity and transparency, availability and diligence, independence and
impartiality, confidentiality and fees. While these measures are
mandated for all engineers, they are more relevant for the independent
engineer who practices alone primarily because many of these measures
are inculcated by organizational policies for engineers employed in an
organization. Each of these aspects of trustbuilding is described in
detail below:</p>
<h5 id="disclosure-of-limits-1">Disclosure of Limits</h5>
<p>Full disclosure to the client of the abilities and limitations of an
engineer is a basic building block for trust. By responsibly disclosing
the ability of the engineer, in terms of material resources (equipment,
finances, space) or intellectual resources (people, skills) or time
resources, the engineer is sending a clear message to the client about
their abilities. Thus, the client does not overestimate the ability of
the engineer to deliver. While disclosing resources, it is important for
the engineer to do so in a responsible fashion, so that the engineer is
not seen to be reckless (over estimates their abilities) or a nay-sayer
(under estimates their abilities).</p>
<h5 id="integrity-and-transparency">Integrity and Transparency</h5>
<p>An engineer must act in a fashion that demonstrates integrity and
transparency in their professional work. One means of demonstrating
integrity and transparency is to inform the client, at the beginning, of
the terms of agreement in writing. Subsequently, the engineer should
ensure a document trail in all interactions between engineer and client.
By documenting all interactions, the engineer sends a clear message that
they are acting in a transparent manner. Integrity and transparency can
also be fostered by furnishing explanations as and when requested by the
client. When these explanations are provided, it is important to ensure
that contradictory explanations are not provided. Furthermore, when the
client ignores the engineer’s advice, the engineer must inform the
client in writing the nature of consequences for ignoring their
advice.</p>
<h5 id="availability-and-diligence">Availability and Diligence</h5>
<p>The engineer must demonstrate reasonable availability and diligence
in professional practice. A good way of demonstrating this is by making
known the engineer’s working hours and contacts, and then ensuring the
client can reach the engineer during these hours. Similarly, the
engineer must give advance notice, if for some reason they wish to cease
working for the client. The engineer can only cease to work for the
client for some clearly defined grounds. These grounds are if the work
involves illegal or fraudulent acts, if the client ignores the
engineer’s advice, and if there is a conflict of interest. We will
describe what is meant by conflict of interest later in this
podcast.</p>
<h5 id="independence-and-impartiality">Independence and
Impartiality</h5>
<p>It is of utmost importance that the engineer ensure that their
professional independence and impartiality is maintained at all costs.
In order to do so, the engineer is required to take precautions to
safeguard their independence and impartiality. One key fashion to do so
is to avoid situations of conflict of interest. Another measure is to
subordinate one’s personal interest to the interest of the client.
Another means of ensuring impartiality is to ensure that the engineer
does not receive fees for services provided from anyone else other than
the client or the client’s representative. These measures may seem minor
but are important to ensure that the engineer is not just impartial and
independent in actions but is also perceived to be so.</p>
<h5 id="confidentiality-1">Confidentiality</h5>
<p>It is of utmost importance that the engineer safeguard the
confidentiality of the information provided by the client. In doing so,
the engineer needs to remember that they are not authorized to share any
of the client’s information, unless explicitly released from secrecy by
the client or requested to do so by a court of law. In addition to not
releasing the information, the engineer is expected not to use the
client’s information in a way that will prejudice the client or accept
another mandate that will involve disclosing a previous client’s
information.</p>
<h5 id="fees-1">Fees</h5>
<p>An engineer is expected to charge fair and reasonable fees that
correspond to the services rendered. The expectation is that neither
will an engineer overcharge the client, nor will the engineer provide
services for free. In fact, the engineer is forbidden from providing
services for free. Accordingly, the client should be given a written
explanation for the fees that were charged.</p>
<h5 id="conflict-of-interest-1">Conflict of Interest</h5>
<p>As we had mentioned earlier, a professional relationship with a
client or employer is considered a fiduciary relationship. Such a
relationship creates a legal obligation for the professional to always
act in the positive interests of the client. One of the factors that can
compromise the fiduciary nature of this relationship is conflict of
interest. Conflict of interest can be defined as the existence of a
parallel interest that could threaten or appear to threaten the exercise
of good judgment of the typical professional. A key point is that
conflicts of interest affect the professional interest and judgment of a
professional. Another vital aspect of a conflict of interest is that
perception is very important. As a professional, you may be confident
that in a particular situation you have not acted in conflict of
interest or that your judgment has not been compromised. But if popular
perception is that a typical professional’s judgment could be affected
in these circumstances, then you are in conflict of interest
irrespective of your convictions. Conflicts of interest come in several
types.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common type is when the professional receives gifts,
bribes, or kickbacks in order to influence their decision.</li>
<li>Another type of conflict of interest is insider information for
friends or relatives. For example, if you are hiring someone for the
company, and your brother has applied for the job. This situation
exposes you to conflict of interest.</li>
<li>A third type of conflict of interest is the existence of interests
in other companies. An example of this would be when you, as a
professional, are working as a designer for one firm, while you have
investment interests in a competing firm.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a professional, avoid putting yourself in conflict of interest
situations. If it is unavoidable, a professional’s only safeguard is
full disclosure of conflict, so that the conflict of interest stands
revealed.</p>
<h4 id="nature-of-loyalty">Nature of Loyalty</h4>
<h5 id="loyalty-1">Loyalty</h5>
<p>Loyalty is usually described as an attitude or character that is
demonstrated by a person through their actions. A clear demonstration of
loyalty is when a person puts the interests of a person or institution
(such as family, community, or nation) before personal interests, even
when such an action exposes the person to risk. In thinking about
loyalty in the professional sphere, it is important to distinguish
between two kinds of loyalty – attitude loyalty and agency loyalty.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attitude loyalty is loyalty that is considered an attitude or
sentiment of a person. It is an emotional or identity response that
arises from group affiliation. A display of attitude loyalty is
considered a desirable quality (but usually not an obligation) for
members.</li>
<li>Another type of loyalty is agency loyalty that arises from
fulfilling contractual duties. For example, if you are hired to perform
a task in an organization, you are required to be a loyal agent as long
as you work for the organization. Agency loyalty is a mandatory
obligation that is fulfilled by obeying legitimate authority of
colleagues and superiors and by following all policies and norms of the
organization you work for.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="assessing-the-moral-status-of-loyalty-1">Assessing the moral
status of loyalty</h5>
<p>While loyalty is usually considered a positive sentiment in personal
lives, the requirement of loyalty in professional lives needs careful
evaluation. A sentimental consideration is unsuitable in the
professional context. This is because an emotional form of loyalty
requires unquestioned or absolute loyalty. Such an absolute response
towards superiors or the organization would limit the possibility for an
individual to develop an appropriate ethical response to forms of
immoral action by the organization, superiors or colleagues. Instead,
loyalty in the professional context requires use of judgment to develop
and practice loyalty. It requires individuals to think carefully about
what loyalty means and how much is owed in the professional context. A
good strategy is to critically evaluate the organization and how it
treats employees in order to assess the nature of loyalty that is owed
by an employee. It is important to think through questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I feel a sense of gratitude towards my employer?</li>
<li>Is there a sense of fairness in the workplace?</li>
<li>Is this organization responsive to the needs and concerns of its
employees?</li>
<li>Does this organization offer rewards and acknowledgements?</li>
<li>Am I proud of this organization?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lesson-7">Lesson 7</h3>
<h4 id="professional-dignity">Professional Dignity</h4>
<p>Dignity is a feeling of respect or esteem that an individual holds
themselves in. Certain actions can cause damage to the positive sense of
esteem about the person. Causing damage to the positive feeling of
esteem of a person could cause grievous psychological harm to the
individual. In a similar fashion, professional dignity is considered a
positive sense of esteem that the profession has collectively acquired
as result of the positive contributions the profession makes to society.
But this dignity or honourable reputation of the profession is fragile
and can easily be compromised. Any member of the profession, through
their irresponsible actions can cause damage to the dignity of the
profession. In Québec, it is a mandatory duty of each individual
engineer to safeguard the dignity of the profession. This duty is
prescribed in the province’s Professional Code and in the Code of Ethics
for Engineers.</p>
<h4
id="relations-with-the-order-of-engineers-ordre-des-ingenieurs">Relations
with the Order of Engineers (Ordre des Ingenieurs)</h4>
<p>Maintaining professional dignity requires the individual professional
to demonstrate adequate respect for the Order, and for the role the
Order plays in ensuring engineers are accountable to society. As a
result, it is very important for the individual engineer to take his or
her relations with the Order very seriously. These relations are
scrutinized very strictly by the Order. One important requirement is for
an engineer to comply with any request from the Order to participate in
the self-governance of the profession. The engineer does not have a
choice and must agree to contribute voluntarily to the Order. Similarly,
the engineer must reply to any correspondence or letter from the Order
as soon as possible. Delayed replies could form the basis for a
disciplinary investigation. Another vital point is that individuals are
forbidden to interfere, or otherwise, obstruct a professional inspection
or investigation conducted by the Order. During such an inspection or
investigation, an engineer is required to submit all their professional
records (including their computers) for scrutiny. Not complying with
such an order can result in a disciplinary investigation.</p>
<h4 id="oiq-controls-over-its-members">OIQ Controls Over its
Members</h4>
<p>The Order of Engineers Quebec (OIQ) exercises considerable control
over its members to ensure that the association as a whole is meeting
its legislative mandate of developing engineers, who remain accountable
to society and who contribute positively to public welfare. In order to
do so, OIQ exerts control on key aspects – membership, nature of
practice, and social accountability. We will examine each of these
aspects in detail.</p>
<p><strong>Membership</strong> For an engineer, to be a member of the
OIQ is crucial to practice the profession. This is so because in Quebec
a person can be designated an engineer in the workplace only if they are
a registered member of OIQ. A member of OIQ is required to hold a permit
issued by OIQ and their name be entered on OIQ’s roll. Thus, if for some
reason they lose their membership, it is not possible for the person to
continue practicing the engineering profession legally. Thus, it becomes
vital for a member to constantly meet membership conditions. Important
membership conditions are as follows:</p>
<p>Ensure registration on the roll every year on April 1st. Not be
temporarily or permanently stricken off the roll of OIQ. Ensure that
your permit is not revoked by the disciplinary council. Meet important
membership conditions for member renewal. These conditions include not
having a criminal record outside the profession in Canada or in another
country. Another condition is to have completely paid any disciplinary
penalties or assessment during the year.</p>
<p>It may also be required to meet physical/mental competencies to
continue active professional life.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of Practice</strong> A major function of OIQ is to
ensure continuous monitoring of the practice of engineers registered
with it. OIQ employs different methods to monitor the professional
practice. A vital and ongoing responsibility is exercised through the
process of professional inspection. Professional inspection is conducted
at OIQ by the Professional Inspection Committee. The primary mission of
the inspection committee is to ensure that their membership meets
minimum required standards for proper professional practice. In order to
evaluate standards of professional practice, inspectors can examine any
material aspect of practice, including records, books, registers,
chemicals, products, substances, apparatus, and equipment entrusted to
the professional by a client or employer. The Committee conducts general
inspection according to a program published in the PLAN (the
professional magazine published by the OIQ). In addition to the general
inspection, the committee also conducts specialized inspection of a
member, if it is explicitly asked to do so as part of an investigation.
If during the inspection, the committee believes that the member is
engaging in unethical practice, it cannot take disciplinary action but
it can inform the Syndic if there are reasonable grounds that an offence
has been committed.</p>
<p>Another major aspect of professional practice that is controlled by
OIQ is discipline and penalty. All members of OIQ (including retired
members or junior engineers) can have their professional practice
investigated. Investigation is an internal process that aims to examine
if unethical or offending practice was undertaken by a member. Once the
process of investigation concludes that unethical practice was indeed
conducted, the member is liable for disciplinary actions or penalties.
In Québec, the OIQ has exclusive jurisdiction over any such
investigations or disciplinary processes. In other words, these
investigations or disciplinary processes cannot be challenged in a
regular civil or criminal court. Investigations of malpractice are
investigated by the Syndic. After concluding the investigation, the
Syndic makes their recommendation to the OIQ’s disciplinary council. It
is the disciplinary council that judges the complaint, hears the member
and makes a decision to award penalties. According to the gravity of the
offense committed by the engineer, the disciplinary council can
recommend the following penalties – an oral reprimand; removing the
member temporarily or permanently from the roll; a fine of
$1,000-$12,500 with fines doubled for repeat offences; an obligation to
remit a sum of money to the entitled person; or restriction or
suspension to engage in professional activities.</p>
<p><strong>Social Accountability</strong> A key means of ensuring that
members remain accountable to society is through the conciliation or
arbitration process. The conciliation or arbitration process is a means
adopted by OIQ to serve society. Any resident of Québec, who is unhappy
over the fees they provided to an engineer and feels they were
over-charged, can utilize OIQ’s arbitration process to determine if they
were actually over-charged. This procedure applies only when the member
is engaged in private practice and not employed by a company. As part of
the arbitration process, the OIQ can examine the quality of service
provided by the engineer to verify if the client was overcharged or not.
If the investigation reveals that the engineer did over-charge the
client for their services, OIQ’s council of arbitration will determine
the amount of reimbursement the engineer has to pay to the client.</p>

A young and relatively inexperienced development engineer with XYZ Appliance,Joe has just been given the green light to develop an idea he had for a modular water purifier for the home. Not only had Tom Wang,Director of New Product Development, liked the idea,but he had asked Joe to form and head a project team to develop a prototype. Joe walks out of Tom Wang's office feeling "on top of the world." However,things don't go exactly to plan.

Joe sets to work.However.he soon discovers that he has underestimated costs.Unfortunately.the budget is fixed.
What do you suggest Joe should do?

A.Abandon the project
B.Select team members with less experience to keep labour costs down

Joe
Joe takes your advice.He chooses to work with less experienced team members.Unfortunately,because of the inexperience of the team.some design choices have to be changed.

He also realizes that the cost of the prototype (and the ultimate selling price of the appliance)will be higher than originally estimated.

Still,the day comes when the project team runs a series of successful tests on an operating prototype.

Joe sets up a review and demonstration with Tom,who then agrees to arrange a review with XYZ's Vice President of Marketing to ascertain Marketing's interest in the water purifier.

I wish you guys in development would ask for marketing input before you begin to work on a new  product.I can tell you right now that our department is not nterested in any type of water appliance!

Honestly.I think you've wasted company money.From my viewpoint,you can shut down the project and put your prototype 'on the shelf.'I'll get back to you if we ever develop interest in this area.but don't expect that to be soon!

Well.that didn't go well.Sorry about this.Joe.I guess our hands are tied.Just write up the final report.Unfortunately. we'll need to consign the prototype to the development "morgue".

Okay.Tom.This is too bad.We should have consulted with Marketing first!
I don't accept this!I am sure this device can be profitable.If we only had proof to share with Marketing!

Tom sighs deeply.

Joe is disheartened,but he decides not to give up.XYZ has a policy of permitting research and  evelopment employees to use 10 percent of their time to pursue new ideas without further authorisation.
So,Joe continues to work on the water purifier project during this time. Although he has every intention of confining his time on the project to 10 percent,he soon becomes so absorbed in the work that he spends
more and more time. 
He makes additional vendor contacts to get improved materials,"cons"a friend in Electronics Research to work on the control system,and has the machine shop do additional work on the prototype (charging shop time to another project of his). 
Through these efforts,Joe makes substantial improvements to the water purification appliance.

In your opinion,has Joe been loyal or disloyal to his company?

A.Loyal.Despite his less-than-upfront methods,he has produced a potentially marketable device!
B.Disloyal.Despite the positive result,he has abused trust and gone against company policy.

choose B
That's right.Joe has been disloyal to his company.Loyalty to the employer requires that employees follow company rules and the directives of supervisors unless those actions infringe upon the law or higher ethical principles-which is not the case here.

As well as ignoring policy,he has been dishonest in acquiring time and resources for the project.

Remind Joe which type of loyalty he should have demonstrated in this case?

A.Attitude loyalty
**B.Agency loyalty**
C.Brand loyalty

Joe is not a quitter.He believes that with some additional market data he can finally convince Tom to continue with the project and push for a marketing go-ahead. Joe had often discussed the
project with his wife.One day she gives him an idea about how to quickly gather market data.She had seen a food products exhibitor in a local shopping mall get passers-by to answer
questionnaires about the products displayed. Maybe he could gather market data on the water purifier in a similar way!

What do you think?Should Joe gather data at the shopping mall?

yes 

You are probably wrong.However.Joe is very pleased with your input.It is exactly what he had hoped to hear!

Joe arranges for members of his wife's garden club to demonstrate the water purifier for free at the local mall and to ask viewers to fill out a questionnaire determining their interest in the appliance and the price they would pay if it were for sale.

Joe is careful not to show any XYZ identification on the prototype,particularly because he has no  authorisation to remove it from the XYZ laboratory.Which dangers might you remind Joe of?

A: He could reveal confidential design information to competitors.This could harm his company economically.
B: He hasn't informed his supervisor about his plan to collect market data,which could undermine professional trust.
C: He has ignored company regulations by removing the prototype from the lab.He could face sanctions.
D : All of the above

Despite an amateurish approach,a considerable amount of data is collected.Reviewing the data.Joe is more convinced than ever that he has developed a marketable product and is eager to convince Tom of the potential.
He resolves to see Tom as soon as possible.

Now Tom faces a dilemma.Although he likes Joe,his response to Joe's actions could set a precedent for other employees in the organization.Which would be his best response when presented with Joe's market data?

A.Tom should simply overlook Joe's lack of transparency and failure to follow some company regulations.After all, Joe's initiative could increase company profits.
B.Tom should praise Joe a give him a job promotion for his extraordinary initiative.
C.While acknowledging Joe's efforts toward the product development,Tom should reprimand or impose a penalty on Joe for failing to show agency loyalty.

Correct.Despite Joe's initiative,Tom should reprimand or impose a penalty on Joe.Not doing so could encourage a culture of poor agency loyalty.

A recent graduate of Engineering Tech,Sophie has been employed in research and development at Larom Chemical for the past several months. Sophie was recommended to Larom as the top Engineering Tech graduate in chemical engineering. Alex Blunt,the head of Sophie's unit, showed immediate interest in her research on processes using a particular catalyst.(We will call it catalyst B.) However,until last week,Sophie's primary research assignments at Larom were in other areas,and she has only recently begun new research on catalyst B. Today,she received an e-mail message from Alex.It was copied to all members of the research and development unit.

To:Research and Development Team
From:Alex Blunt
Subject:Re:Decision on Catalyst for product X
Dear team members:
I would like to convene an immediate meeting with all engineers in the unit.
Within the next few days,our unit must recommend which catalyst Larom should use in processing  roduct X-a new product you all know is extremely important for the financial future of this company.
Since many members of the team have had experience with potential catalysts for the process,I anticipate a brief,decisive meeting.
Let's gather at 2 pm this Friday in our regular meeting room to decide.
Best,
Alex

Alex says:"So,team,which catalyst should we recommend for product X?"
other enginner1 says"We've been working on projects like this for years,and catalyst A seems the obvious choice."
enginner2 says "I concur.Catalyst A is the obvious choice."
Alex says:"Well,it looks like we should recommend catalyst A as the best choice.Do we have consensus?"

So far.Sophie has said nothing.She is unsure what further testing will show.but her testing over the past week provides some preliminary evidence that catalyst B may.in fact,be better for this process.
This finding is also in line with her own research at Engineering Tech,based on somewhat similar  processes.The process would require fewer metals,and the spent catalyst would be more easily recycled.
Although more costly initially.the process with catalyst B could lead to cost savings in the long run.Still,she hesitates because she feels she should defer to the experience of more senior engineers.
Should Sophie break group consensus by suggesting catalyst B may be a better option?

**yes**

That's right.By contributing based on her knowledge and honest convictions.she is acting with honesty and independence.In fact.remaining silent-an act of omission-could potentially harm the company in the long term.

At the same time,she will need to be very clear in presenting the limitations of her research on catalyst B.A hasty decision could also prove costly!

Which essential components of trust building should come into play in Sophie's decision to speak up about her research on catalyst B?

A.Disclosing limits,confidentiality,and availability and diligence
**B.Disclosing limits,integrity and transparency,and independence and impartiality**
C.Availability and diligence,confidentiality,and fees

Sophie syas "Catalyst A could work.However,my recent test results show that catalyst B might provide a number of environmental and cost advantages.But I still need to conduct further tests.Could the team wait another two weeks?"

Alex says "It would be nice to do more testing.but we don't have two weeks.We have two days!They're getting impatient on this one,and our unit needs to appear decisive!Besides.I doubt anything would show up in the next two weeks to change our minds.From experience,we know that catalyst A works. Let's wrap this 
up.then.Sophie.I need you to write a report.Leave out the preliminary data gathered about catalyst B."

Sophie says:"But,with due respect,even if the data on catalyst B is left out,the data on catalyst A is hardly conclusive."

Alex says:"Look.you're bright.You can make the numbers look good without difficulty.Do the math backwards if you have to! Let's recommend catalyst A."

Alex is Sophie's team leader.Would she show a lack of "agency loyalty"-in other words,professional loyalty to her employer-by not complying with wishes of her direct supervisor?

**No**

That's right.While it is true that agency loyalty requires following company rules along with the directives of supervisors,this must not be done uncritically

In this case,the team leader is suggesting an unethical action-misrepresentation of research data in the interest of expediency.A critical approach to agency loyalty would require greater honesty.integrity.and transparency.

A.Follow Alex's suggestion to "do the math backwards"to show that catalyst A is the better option.
B.State that the data on catalyst A is hardly conclusive but not mention data on catalyst B.
**C.Include the current data of catalyst A but state also that further research should be conducted on both catalysts A and B before choosing the final option.**

That's right.Professional values of honesty,integrity,and transparency suggest this is the best approach.

After completing the initial report. Sophie has an opportunity to do more research on catalyst B.After several weeks,her research decisively indicates that catalyst B would have been the better choice. Still,she feels apprehensive going against the initial recommendations of more senior engineers on the team.She also fears repercussions on her career if she counters the wishes of her immediate supervisor.

what should Sophie do
A.She should keep the data for herself and only disclose findings to Alex by request.
B.She should disclose the new data and results immediately to Alex.
C.She should send the data to another lab for further investigation and validation of the results.
**D.She should write and submit another report presenting the new data and results.**
That's right.Documenting the results of her research in a second report is the most transparent option because it leaves a document trail.

Even if,based on the recommendations of more senior engineers,the company chooses to go with catalyst A-the more costly and less environmentally friendly option-Sophie will still have acted with  honesty.integrity,and transparency. -->

<h4 id="duty-towards-the-public">Duty towards the Public</h4>
<p>This is a key duty for engineers who wish to practice the profession
in Québec. Here the term public is understood very broadly. When we use
the term public, we usually mean citizens. The meaning of public refers
to the duty of engineers to the citizens of Québec/Canada. But it also
uses public in another sense to mean the opposite of private. In that
sense, public means the common good of people in Québec. Engineers have
a duty to safeguard the common public good in Québec. This duty to
safeguard the common public good is enforced through two duties – the
first to humanity and the second to protect life and environment.</p>
<h5 id="duty-to-humanity"><strong>Duty to Humanity</strong></h5>
<p>The Code of Ethics for engineers specifies that fundamentally “In all
aspects of their work an engineer must respect their obligations towards
humanity.” This duty specifies that, first and foremost, engineers exist
to protect and respect humans. While this obligation towards humans
arises from many civil and criminal laws, fundamentally it is governed
by key legal frameworks in Canadian and Québec law – the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Québec Charter of Human Rights
and Freedoms. The Canadian charter guarantees certain fundamental
freedoms to humans living in the country. These freedoms include
fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of conscience, religion, belief,
expression, and association. In addition, the charter gives rights, such
as democratic rights, mobility right, legal rights, equality rights, and
language rights. In other words, in their work, professionals have a
duty to not violate the provisions of the Canadian charter and the
Québec charter. One major implication of this duty is to ensure that
engineers do not engage in discrimination of any form. Discrimination is
a violation of the Canadian charter, especially the equality rights
specified in it. In turn, this means that no professional may refuse to
provide services to a person because of their race, colour, age, sex,
religion, national origin or ethnicity of such person.</p>
<h5 id="duties-towards-life-and-environment"><strong>Duties towards Life
and Environment </strong></h5>
<p>The Code of Ethics also specifies that “In all aspects of their work,
the engineer must take into account the consequences of the performance
of his work on the environment and on the life, health and property of
every person.” There are two aspects to this duty. The first is to act
in a manner to safeguard the environment, and the second is to be
mindful of the life, health, and property of every human. Safeguarding
the environment requires the engineer to be mindful of technological
choices that do not promote the pollution and eventual destruction of
the environment and will further sustainable development. The respect
for life, health and property relates closely to the rights mentioned in
the Canadian charter.</p>
<h4 id="ethical-constructs"><strong>Ethical Constructs</strong></h4>
<h5 id="prejudice"><strong>Prejudice</strong></h5>
<p>An opinion formed without taking time and care to judge fairly, often
based on incomplete and stereotyped in formation.</p>
<h5 id="discrimination"><strong>Discrimination</strong></h5>
<p>Treating people differently because of some particular social
sttribute such as race, gender or religion. <strong>Adverse effect
discrimination</strong></p>
<p>Discrimination that happens as a result of applying a rule or policy
uniformaly.</p>

</figure>
<h5 id="harassment"><strong>Harassment</strong></h5>
<p>This is a particular type of discrimination. It occurs when a person
is subjected to unwanted behaviour that offends, demeans or humiliates.
1. Sexual 2. Racial 3. Ridicule</p>
<h4 id="thinking-about-inclusivity-and-diversity"><strong>Thinking About
Inclusivity and Diversity</strong></h4>
<p>We have seen that professionals have a duty to not violate the
provisions of the Canadian charter and the Québec charter. One major
implication of this duty is to ensure that engineers do not engage in
discrimination of any form. But what is meant by discrimination, and how
does it relate to priorities in Canadian society? We will examine these
aspects in detail.</p>
<p><strong>Prejudice, Discrimination, and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>In thinking about discrimination, it is useful to understand the
concept in the context of two related concepts of prejudice and
harassment. The Association of Professional Engineers, Geophysicists,
and Geologists of Alberta (APEGGA) defines prejudice as an opinion
formed without taking time and care to judge fairly, often based on
incomplete and stereotyped information. The key point is that prejudice
is a biased opinion that is often based on incomplete information.
Discrimination is usually built on prejudiced opinions, but it takes
prejudice a step further because it influences behaviours.
Discrimination implies treating people differently because of some
particular social attribute, such as race, gender or religion.
Discrimination, when it results in an extreme form of behavior, results
in harassment. It occurs when an individual is subjected to unwanted
behaviour that offends, demeans, or humiliates.</p>
<p>Discrimination comes in several forms, some of them are directed
while others are less easy to identify. Direct discrimination is
discrimination that is directed against person(s) on the basis of
prejudice. This is the most clearly identifiable form of discrimination,
primarily because it happens in the open so that people become aware of
it. Another form of discrimination is adverse effect discrimination. It
is a discrimination that happens as a result of applying a rule or
policy uniformly. When governments or companies apply a policy in
society, it often discriminates against groups in society as a result. A
good example is positive discrimination in hiring that favours visible
minorities or women. There is an adverse effect discrimination that is
created against those who do not fall within these groups. Their chances
at getting the same jobs have been reduced because of the preference
that underrepresented groups have. A final form of discrimination is
systemic discrimination. This discrimination is widespread but not very
easy to identify. It is a discrimination that is rooted in accepted ways
of doing things in a business, profession, or occupation. This tends to
prevent categories of people from achieving their goals. A good example
of this is the glass ceiling. The glass ceiling is the existence of a
barrier that prevent women from advancing in their careers in that
organization beyond a particular level.</p>
<p><strong>Multiculturalism and Diversity</strong></p>
<p>Multiculturalism and diversity are the opposite of discrimination.
Diversity is the variety in different social categories, such as gender,
race, ethnicity, age, religion, national origin or sexual orientation.
Multiculturalism is an equal acceptance for social differences in terms
of gender, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race or national origin.
While diversity is the presence of cultural differences in society,
multiculturalism is a positive accepting attitude towards these
differences. Such a multicultural orientation that fosters diversity has
several advantages. It fosters a spirit of mutual understanding in the
workplace, and more importantly, it allows everyone to develop their
abilities to its full potential. In Canada, multiculturalism is an
official policy that reflects an equal acceptance of races, religions,
languages and cultures. This policy is furthered through Canadian
legislation. The preservation and enhancement of multicultural heritage
in Canada is the aim of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In
addition, Canada’s Multiculturalism Act of 1988 protects aboriginal
rights, and the rights of people to enjoy their cultures and use of
languages other than English and French. This legal background has
allowed a mix of ethnic groups, languages, and cultures to co-exist in
Canada. It is for these reasons that Canada is considered a cultural
mosaic unlike U.S., which has adopted a melting pot approach. Canada,
unlike U.S., seeks to foster diversity without assimilating different
cultural groups.</p>
<h4 id="honesty-1">Honesty</h4>
<p>Honesty is a moral virtue that is widely accepted but not very well
understood, primarily because it is a practice relevant to many
different facets of our existence in society. In such a situation, since
we could encounter honesty in so many spheres of our life, we do not
often realize that we have been honest or dishonest in a particular
aspect. In the personal sphere, honesty can be interpreted as
truth-telling. So an honest person is one who can be relied on to tell
the truth irrespective of circumstances. But in the professional
context, honesty is not limited to just speaking the truth. It also
implies representing oneself, our actions, and our views openly and
truthfully. So in addition to honesty being the act of truth telling, it
also means that to be honest in the workplace implies the act of
following scientific facts, the act of avoiding inappropriate means, and
the act of showing respect to colleagues in a professional relationship.
The difference between honesty as truth-telling and honesty as correct
representation of actions can be distinguished by the difference between
an act of commission and an act of omission. While telling a deliberate
lie would be an act of commission on the part of the person speaking a
lie; on the other hand, we lie by omission when we neglect to mention a
relevant event, information, or circumstance to a person. Thus, honest
representation requires us to avoid both acts of commission and
omission.</p>
<p><strong>Duty to be Honest</strong> Although not mentioned separately
as a mandatory duty for engineers, the duty to be honest has
considerable overlap with the trust-building obligations of engineers
towards clients or employers and with their duty towards humanity. But a
few obligations indicate the duty to be honest. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The engineer shall express their opinion on matters dealing with
engineering, only if such opinion is based on sufficient knowledge and
honest convictions.</li>
<li>An engineer must be impartial in their relations between the client
and the contractors, suppliers, etc.</li>
<li>An engineer must safeguard their independence at all times to avoid
situations of conflict of interest.
<strong>Whistleblowing</strong><br />
Whistleblowing is an act that follows directly from the requirement of
engineers to be honest and transparent in their actions and views. It
has been defined as an act by an employee of informing the public or
higher management of unethical or illegal behavior by an employer or
supervisor. As an engineer, if you come to know of the commission of
unethical or illegal actions in the workplace, your duty to be honest as
an engineer demands that you approach either the supervisor or the
public to reveal the existence of such actions. Not doing so would mean
you have engaged in an act of omission. Whistleblowing can be
categorized into two types – internal or external, depending upon
whether the whistle is blown inside or outside the organization.
Internal whistleblowing would mean going over the head of an immediate
supervisor (who maybe engaged in unethical action) to a higher level of
management. External whistleblowing would mean going outside the company
and report unethical or illegal actions to the media or to
law-enforcement agencies directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of professional engineering in Québec, there are well
instituted procedures for whistleblowing. At a first level, when you
encounter an illegal or unethical action in your workplace, your action
should be to bring it to the attention of the company, first verbally,
and then failing which clearly indicate in writing to the company, the
consequences that may result from ignoring your advice. If after this,
there is no satisfactory resolution, as an engineer, your option,
especially when certain works are a danger to public safety, must be to
notify the Order. For an engineer in Québec, going public would imply
approaching the OIQ rather than going to the media.</p>
<h4 id="test">Test</h4>
<p>Assume you are a professional engineer working for the Canadian
branch of a large high-precision manufacturing company with a head
office in Antarctica. A huge international technical conference is tobe
held in your city,including technical seminars and a tradeshow.Your
company wants to present its products and services at the trade show.
You are in charge of planning,designing,and staffing several product
displays.</p>
<p>On the first day of the trade show,you have everything ready
displays,booths,and literature and you have arranged with an employment
agency to hire a temporary receptionist. The receptionist arrives
early,and she appears suitable for the job.</p>
<p>However,before you can explain her duties,your boss calls you aside,
observes that the receptionist is a woman and states</p>
<p>He explains that women are very rare in the workplace in the country
where the head office is located.And when the chief executives arrive,
they definitely will not expect a woman receptionist to welcome them and
other visitors to the company display.So your boss instructs you What
should you do?</p>
<h3 id="lesson-9">lesson 9</h3>
<h4 id="law-and-legal-systems">Law and Legal Systems</h4>
<p><strong>Law</strong> Law, as we have described earlier, is a rule
that regulates what is accepted or forbidden in a society. Laws are
created by a competent authority, such as a parliament or a legislative
assembly. Laws are enforced through a system composed of enforcement
agencies (example: the police) and the judiciary. The body of law that
governs a society can be subdivided, according to its focus, into two
broad domains – public law and private law. Public laws are those laws
that govern the actions of the state (or government) or the relations of
the state and individuals. Examples of public law are international law,
constitutional law, administrative law, or criminal law. Private law, on
the other hand, is solely concerned with regulating the relations and
disputes between private individuals. Examples of private law include
commercial law, family law, property law, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Systems</strong> Legal systems are related to laws, but
as the name implies, it is the system that has built up around the
process of implementing laws in a society. Legal systems could be
defined as existing system for interpreting and enforcing laws. A legal
system becomes the basis for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sources of laws and regulations that govern a society</li>
<li>The practices and customs followed by courts in interpreting laws to
make decisions regarding legal disputes</li>
<li>And as frameworks that govern interpretation of statutes,
legislation and bylaws Different countries around the world have
different legal systems. In this module, you will find a map of the
world indicating the major legal systems and their combinations, which
are prevalent in different countries. Click on the major legal systems
to understand their key features. In this class, we are concerned with
two major legal systems – civil law and English common law systems.
There are some key features that distinguish these two major legal
systems. First, in a civil law system, laws are written into systematic
collections referred to as codes. Second, Laws are created by
legislatures alone. Third, legal decisions made by judges are based
solely on applying the laws to the case. Finally, justice is produced
through an inquisitorial process led by the judge. English common law,
on the other hand, is based on laws and earlier cases that are similar.
Second, laws are created both by legislatures and judges on the basis of
the precedence value of earlier cases and judgments. Third, legal
decisions are based not only on laws but also on precedence value of
previous judgments. Finally, justice is produced through an adversarial
process between two opposing sets of advocates with the judge acting as
a neutral umpire.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Québec’s Legal System</strong><br />
Québec’s legal system is unique in Canada, because it has a mixed legal
system. While other provinces in Canada follow the English common law
system, Québec, given its French history, follows a mixed legal system
that has elements of English common law and French civil law. In Québec,
all criminal matters are decided through English common law, while
property and civil matters for disputes between private citizens are
based on the Québec Civil Code. Québec Civil Code is derived from French
civil law, and therefore, legislation is the primary source of law and
courts are not dependent on taking into account the precedence value of
previous judgments. Laws in the Québec Civil Code have been arranged
systematically to form a code comprising ten books. Each book deals with
a body of law, such as persons, family, successions, property, etc.</p>

<h4 id="intellectual-property-in-canada">Intellectual Property in
Canada</h4>
<p>In our modern innovation-driven economy, ideas (especially new ideas)
are valuable commodities that often form the basis for lucrative
commercial ventures. If we look around, we can quickly see how some
ideas have become the basis for popular devices, objects, technologies,
or programs. In such a situation, these ideas are indeed very valuable
and require legal protection so that those who developed these ideas can
derive benefit from them. In law, novel ideas are considered
intellectual property and, if it meets certain conditions, can acquire
the same kinds of protection that other pieces of property like land,
money, or houses have. Canada recognizes five major types of
intellectual property – patents, copyright, trademark, industrial design
protection and Integrated Circuit Topographies (ICT) protection. All
types of intellectual property are protected through dedicated federal
laws. Intellectual property is administered in Canada through the
Canadian Intellectual Property Office. You can visit their website
http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca for more information regarding intellectual
property administration in Canada. We will now describe each major kind
of intellectual property in detail.</p>
<p><strong>Patents</strong> A Patent is a government grant that gives
inventors exclusive rights to their inventions. It gives the inventor an
exclusive right to make, sell, and use the invention. In order to
receive a patent, the invention must meet the following criteria – it
must be new; must show utility (or in other words, must be working model
that is functional and operative, it is not enough to have a concept);
and must show inventive ingenuity not obvious to someone with the same
skills. A patent can be given for a product, a chemical composition or
process, but it cannot be granted for a principle, theorem, idea, or
computer program. The term of the protection for any new patent is 20
years from the date the application was filed.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright</strong><br />
A copyright protects the expression of information in literary, musical,
dramatic, or artistic works. The work must be published, recorded,
performed, or communicated in order for the copyright protection to
apply. Copyright provides the author the exclusive right to allow
someone to copy a creative work. The following are not eligible for
copyright protection ‒ facts, themes, ideas, most titles, names,
catch-phrases, and other short-word combinations. Copyright is owned by
the creator, employer, or one who commissioned it. One aspect that makes
copyright unique is that it does not require registration. All it
requires that the author place the copyright symbol © followed by the
author’s name and year in the work to gain copyright protection. In
Canada, the duration of copyright protection exists for the life of the
creator plus 50 years following death.</p>
<p><strong>Trademark</strong> A trademark protects marks used to
distinguish goods or services of one organization from those of others.
It is usually provided for catch-phrases, short-word combinations,
symbols or designs, or a combination of these. A registered trademark
allows the owner to use the trademark in association with specific goods
or services. The term of protection is 15 years, but it can be renewed
indefinitely as long as it is in continuous use. There are three types
of trademarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary marks are words and/or symbols that distinguish the goods
or services of a specific firm (e.g., Dell or MacBook).</li>
<li>Certification marks identify goods or services that meet a standard
set by a governing organization (e.g., Energy Star or LEED
certification).</li>
<li>Distinguishing guise identifies the shaping of wares or their
containers, or a mode of wrapping or packaging wares (e.g., iPad).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Industrial Design Protection</strong></p>
<p>Industrial design protection protects the shape, configuration, and
pattern or ornament (or any combination of these) applied to a finished,
mass-produced item. Examples of items protected include furniture, toys,
household items, and vehicles. The protection may apply to, for example,
the shape of a table, or the ornamentation on the handle of a spoon.
What cannot be protected are: the functional features of an article; a
principle of construction, or how an article is built; the materials
used in the construction of an article (for example, glass); colour; or

<h4 id="occupational-health-and-safety-in-canada">Occupational Health
and Safety in Canada</h4>
<p>Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) legislation provides a framework
to regulate and minimize exposure of workers to hazardous or dangerous
working conditions and workplaces. In Canada, the jurisdiction of
legislation is shared between federal and provincial or territorial
governments. However, in practice, over 90% of Canadian workers are
governed under provincial legislation. It is only the remaining 10% of
the workers working in federal installations and workplaces, such as
airports that are governed by federal OHS legislation. Despite the major
provincial role for governing OHS legislation, the federal government
has established the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety
as a clearinghouse and advocacy group to advance safe and healthy
workplaces in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong> OHS legislations in Canada have some
key features that are common to most such legislations. One key feature
is that employees, under OHS legislation, are granted certain rights. An
important right is the ability to refuse to do unsafe work. In other
words, workers can refuse to do work that they think is unsafe or
dangerous. Workers also have the right to be informed about actual and
potential dangers. Another right is to participate in workplace health
and safety activities through Joint Health and Safety Committee (JHSC)
as a worker health and safety representative. In addition to worker
rights, supervisors, or employers have important responsibilities to
ensure workplace safety. Key aspects of supervisor responsibility
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To ensure that workers use prescribed protective equipment
devices</li>
<li>To advise workers of potential and actual hazards</li>
<li>To take every reasonable precaution in the circumstance for the
protection of workers</li>
</ul>
<p>The legislation usually also prescribes responsibility for workers
but these, unlike supervisors’, do not carry a legal burden. Worker
responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>To work in compliance with OHS acts and regulations</li>
<li>To use personal protective equipment and clothing as directed</li>
<li>To report hazards and dangers. Another important aspect of OHS
legislation is the concept of due diligence. Despite, their best
efforts, if there is an accident in the workplace, supervisors can use
due diligence as a defence, if they are charged with violating OHS
guidelines. Due diligence is a legal defence that suggests that all
reasonable precautions, under the particular circumstances, were taken.
If charged under OHS laws, a defendant may be found not guilty, if he or
she can prove that due diligence was exercised in protecting the
workplace.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Québec OHS Legislation</strong><br />
Québec OHS legislation called the Act Respecting Occupational Health and
Safety (Québec) was introduced in 1979. It is a progressive legislation
that has all the major features of OHS legislation in Canada. It
provides workers with the right to refuse unsafe work and participate in
Health and Safety Committees. In addition, it places the burden of
responsibility on employers or supervisors to ensure safe workplaces.
Another feature of Québec’s OHS legislation is that it distinguishes
workplaces into “ordinary” workplaces, where workers are not exposed to
very dangerous environments, and to “special” workplaces, that have
elevated risks of injury. Depending on the nature of the workplace,
different measures are needed.</p>
<h3 id="lesson-10">Lesson 10</h3>
<h4 id="responsibility-and-the-evolution-of-liability">Responsibility
and the Evolution of Liability</h4>
<p><strong>Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>Responsibility can be defined as responding to or answering for an
action performed. All actions that we take have consequences either for
ourselves or for other people who surround us. Now it may not always be
possible to foresee the kind of consequences that may arise from our
actions, but in most situations it is possible to know the consequences
of an individual’s actions. Answering or accounting for the consequences
of ones actions is what is implied by responsibility. In order for a
person to be held morally responsible for an action, we should be able
to determine two aspects. First, we need to verify agency of the action,
in other words who did the action. Second, we need to know the degree of
wilful intent or in other words, the nature of circumstances that guided
the action. In some situations, the responsibility for the action might
be less because of the nature of circumstances. Fixing these two aspects
allows us to fix the moral responsibility of an action.</p>
<p>A key aspect associated with thinking about responsibility is the
concept of role. A role (especially a social role) is a position that an
individual holds. A few such common roles are parent, student,
professor, engineer, doctor, etc. Individuals often fills multiple roles
in society. One could be an engineer who is also a parent. The idea of
role is crucial to understand responsibility. Because if a person fills
a role in society, then society has expectations about how that person
should act in that role. Individuals are held responsible when they do
not meet the expectations of the role they fill in society. So if you
are an engineer, there is an expectation that you will act responsibly
when producing products for society. If you do not meet that
expectation, you will be held responsible for it.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution of Liability</strong></p>
<p>When talking about responsibility in the legal context, we encounter
the term liability. Liability can be defined as the responsibility that
is backed by the power of the law. In other words, if you do not meet
the expected responsibility in your professional work, you could be held
liable or legally responsible by the consumer or client for your
actions, especially if it causes damage to them. Liability can be of two
types ‒ contractual or extra-contractual.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Extra-contractual : responsibility that is owed by tort or
regulatory damages</li>
<li>Contractual: responsibility that is owed within the bounds of an
explicit contract</li>
</ol>
<p>In our description of liability, we are mostly concerned with
extra-contractual liability. In the professional context, we are not
usually concerned with intentional liability, since we assume that
professionals will act in an ethical fashion. However, negligence is
another matter. We have already discussed some aspects of professional
liability arising from negligent practice in an earlier podcast. We will
talk about this in more details in the next podcast also. Here we will
discuss the evolution of product liability or the changes in the
liability associated with goods that are manufactured for society. Till
about two hundred years ago, there was no such thing as product
liability. If a buyer bought a product in the market, it was the buyer
who took the risk of buying, and therefore had to bear the price of any
damage done while using it. There was no compensation that a buyer could
expect for damages, caused by a product that they bought. This legal
approach is referred to as “caveat emptor” – let the buyer beware. In
the last hundred and fifty years, legal systems around the world have
moved away from a caveat emptor approach towards an approach that is
commonly called “caveat vendidor” – let the seller beware. With the
increasing complexity of products, producers, manufacturers, and
designers are now held legally responsible for the products they
introduce in society. The producer is thus expected to compensate for
damages done in the presence of negligent designs or construction. In
the general public interest, product liability in many countries have
moved in the direction of strict liability. Strict liability is the
legal responsibility assigned in the public interest, even in the
absence of negligence on the part of the manufacturer. This has created
the responsibility for engineers to not just make safe products for the
intended user, but also consider its effect on all likely uses and users
of products. A good example of strict liability is the message that
manufacturers put on plastic bags that the bags could be a choking
hazard for children. This message is an effort to reduce the strict
liability that courts assign to a product. While strict liability is
quite common in U.S., in Canadian courts, strict liability is not widely
enforced.</p>
<h4 id="liability-in-québec">Liability in Québec</h4>
<p><strong>Liability</strong></p>
<p>Liability in Québec is enforced through Québec Civil Code. Like in
common law jurisdictions, liability in Quebec is understood as a civil
liability. Civil liability refers to the responsibility of the guilty
party to pay compensation to the plaintiff for damages or harms caused.
There is no punishment in terms of fine or imprisonment that is possible
through liability laws in Québec. Under Québec’s liability legislation,
compensation in damages is awarded only if three things are established
by the plaintiff. First, the plaintiff needs to show that there was an
act of omission in the design or construction of the product. An act of
omission is taken to mean a defect or a negligent construction in the
product. Second, the plaintiff has to demonstrate that a consequence or
damage took place. Third and the most vital part is to demonstrate that
a cause-effect relation exists between the act of omission and the
consequence or damage. In other words, the plaintiff has to demonstrate
that as a result of using the product with the defect, the consumer
suffered damages. If the court is convinced that all three points have
been adequately demonstrated, only then is compensation awarded to the
plaintiff.</p>
<p><strong>Liability Insurance</strong></p>
<p>Liability insurance is purchased to address business liability risks
that are not covered by general liability insurance. Liability insurance
is also referred to as “errors and omissions” insurance or “malpractice”
insurance. In professional practice, a liability insurance policy pays
other parties for damages for which the policy holder is legally liable
as a result of negligent acts, errors or omissions in the performance of
their professional service. While the insurance pays the compensation to
be paid to the plaintiff, it reduces the seriousness that such tort
claims can have on the actions of the professional. On the other hand,
the insurance is useful, because it protects the firm, the professional,
or employees from serious financial disruption. And it provides clients
with financial security for the professional services they have
received.</p>
<p>In Québec, the professional code requires every order to determine
the categories of its members that should secure liability insurance
coverage. The OIQ accordingly adopted a regulation requiring
professional liability insurance for all members. Thus, every member of
the OIQ shall join the group plan insurance contract (with a specified
minimum coverage) to address professional liability.</p>
<h4 id="contract-and-tort">Contract and Tort</h4>
<p><strong>Contract</strong></p>
<p>A contract is a legally 0binding agreement between individuals. Since
it is legally binding, if one party to the agreement does not meet their
obligations, the other party can approach the courts to redress the
situation. A contract can be formally defined as a voluntary agreement
made between at least two persons with the mutual intention of creating
a legal obligation. When courts examine the validity of contracts, they
consider the following elements in deciding on whether the contract is
legal or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, there has to be a mutual voluntary agreement to enter into
the contract. If one party forced another party to enter the agreement,
that makes the contract void and legally unenforceable.</li>
<li>Second, there must be evidence that an offer was made by one party
and the other party accepted the offer and then entered into the
contract. If the court sees an intent to enter into a contract then that
party is thought to have accepted to enter the contract and therefore
making it legally binding.</li>
<li>Third, a contract should have a motive. In other words, there must
be a consideration of benefit for each party to enter into the contract.
If it appears that only one party to the contract is giving something
while the other party has not given anything, then there is no
contract.</li>
<li>Fourth, if the contract is made on an illegal matter, then it is
unenforceable in a court because the contract is considered illegal. For
example, if two people enter into a contract to rob a bank, such a
contract cannot be enforced even if one party is not faithful to the
contract.</li>
<li>Finally, the parties who enter into the contract have to be legal
persons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus vulnerable people like minors, the mentally incapacitated, or
the intoxicated, or aboriginals cannot usually enter into a contract. In
addition individuals like public authorities or associations cannot
enter into contracts. Such contracts are considered null and void.</p>
<p><strong>Contract and Employment</strong></p>
<p>As professionals, a class of contracts they encounter in the
workplace is contracts associated with employment. Depending on their
status in an organization, an employee would sign one of the following
contracts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular employees: an individual who works for an employer and is
entitled to wages under an employment contract that controls the details
of work performance</li>
<li>Contract employees: an individual who has an employment contract for
a fixed term</li>
<li>Independent contractors: an individual who has a contract for
services with the client or customer to undertake a specific project but
who is left free to do the assigned work</li>
</ul>
<p>The following factors help in distinguishing between an employee and
a contractor. In the case of an employee, it is the employer who decides
the work conditions of an employee, such as when they should come to
work. In the case of an employee, it is the employer who owns
tools/equipment to accomplish work-related tasks. Finally, it is the
employer who benefits from any profits or bears losses from doing a
task. In the case of a contractor, in all these factors, the client is
not usually concerned with conditions, tools or bearing profits or
losses. All these are the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Tort</strong></p>
<p>The word tort is derived from the French word tort, which means to do
wrong. In the legal context, tort refers to the breach of a private
obligation to not do wrong to another person. What does private mean in
this sentence? It refers to the idea that the damage caused by one
person is to another person only and not to society as a whole. More
serious actions, such as willful injury or murder, are considered public
damage, because they affect society not just the person who was
affected. It is for this reason that in criminal cases it is the
government that prosecutes the case rather than the victim of the
action. A good example of tort would be a person’s private obligation to
not make defamatory statements against another person. The person, who
makes such statements, may have to face a tort case for their actions.
If found guilty in a tort case, the defendant has to pay compensatory
damages to the plaintiff. There is no punishment or imprisonment
possible within a tort case. There are three types of tort that are
recognized in the law – intentional torts, negligence torts, or strict
liability torts. Intentional torts as the name suggests occur, when a
person acts with the intent of causing harm to another person. Such
torts include fraud, trespass, defamation and intimidation, and assault
and battery. Negligence torts, as the name suggests, is caused when a
person acted negligently to cause harm to another person. Such torts
include nuisance, professional negligence, and product liability. It is
the last two torts that professionals commonly encounter within their
work. It is to avoid these kinds of tort cases that professionals need
to pay attention to the work they do. In trying to determine whether a
professional was negligent in their actions, courts use a standard known
as “duty of care” to evaluate the actions of professionals. The duty of
care can be defined as the professional expectation to exercise
reasonable care to avoid injuring the plaintiff. A final category of
torts is strict liability torts, which do not usually apply in Canada.
Here a person can be held responsible for damages caused to another
person without any negligence or intention.</p>
<h3 id="lesson11">Lesson11</h3>
<h4 id="compromise-and-conflict-resolution">Compromise and Conflict
Resolution</h4>
<p><strong>Compromise</strong></p>
<p>In the context of ethical work practice, compromise is a slippery
term to define. The slipperiness of the concept arises from the fact
that the term can be defined with both positive and negative
connotations. The positive connotation for compromise in a conflict
situation arises from finding a common ground between differing sides in
the spirit of mutual agreement. Another positive connotation associated
with the term is that it suggests the quality of flexibility on the part
of individuals as they adjust their goals in light of the circumstance.
However, at the same time, compromise also possesses some equally
striking negative connotations. Compromise suggests a willingness to
surrender one’s stated objectives and principles. It also suggests a
sign of weakness in conviction. Given these radically differing
connotations, the moral status of compromise is always not very clear
and requires some clarification. In some conditions making a compromise
does not involve ethical issues while in others it does. Under which
conditions is making a compromise an ethical issue?</p>
<p>Making a compromise is not an ethical compromise, when individuals
agree on fundamental values but disagree on the implementation process.
For example, while engineers agree that transparency in job
advertisements is necessary but one feels that advertisements should be
placed on the internet and the other feels they should be placed in the
newspaper. A compromise would mean deciding on an implementation
strategy whereby some jobs are advertised in newspapers, while others
are put on the internet. Making a compromise is not an ethical
compromise when individuals disagree on the relative importance of two
different values for example reliability and inexpensiveness. Using the
example above, if one engineer feels that job advertisements should be
placed on the internet because they are inexpensive, while another
suggests that they should be placed in the newspaper because they are
reliable, then you attempt to develop a synthetic position that
addresses both values. In the example above, a synthetic position would
be to arrive at the understanding that it is enough to advertise jobs at
universities rather than on the internet or newspapers, because they are
both reliable and inexpensive. Making a compromise is an ethical issue,
when parties disagree on the same fundamental value. For example, should
we compromise on harassment? Making such a compromise usually betrays
ones ethical principles and personal integrity. However, even in the
case where there is a disagreement on fundamental values, a compromise
is acceptable under some specific conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a great degree of factual or conceptual uncertainty in
making the decision.</li>
<li>When the moral issue has great complexity and there is no
black/white answer.</li>
<li>When there are resource constraints (time limits or physical
inabilities) that will lead to an imperfect decision.</li>
<li>There is a danger of breaking vital cooperative relationships –
team, friends, or family.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under these conditions, it may be more appropriate to reach a
compromise on a fundamental value conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></p>
<p>In resolving conflicts, it is not just necessary to examine the
ethical aspects of the differences in opinion. It is also necessary to
consider the personal and psychological aspects of how individuals deal
with differences of opinion. Individuals deal with conflict and
disagreement very differently, depending on their workplace
personalities. In thinking about how individuals react in conflict
situations, it is important to consider two aspects regarding how
individuals behave and think. The first aspect is assertiveness or the
degree of concern individuals have about the self, and the second aspect
is cooperativeness or the degree of concern individuals have about
others. The combination of assertiveness or cooperativeness gives
individuals their preferred mode of dealing with conflicts. Becoming
aware of one’s conflict mode as well as the other person’s allows us to
think of a pathway to resolve conflicts. According to these two aspects,
people can be categorized into five modes of conflict handling.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Competing mode: Individual pursues self-interest at the other
person’s expense.</li>
<li>Accommodating mode: Individual neglects self-interest to consider
the other person’s needs.</li>
<li>Avoiding mode: Person avoids conflict situation and does not address
it.</li>
<li>Collaborating mode: Works with the other person to find a solution
that meets the interests of both persons.</li>
<li>Compromising mode: Only partially satisfies both parties.<br />
According to this logic, compromising is an imperfect solution because
it only partially addresses the needs of both parties. However, the
important aspect of this five-part categorization is not to say that one
mode is always better than the others. Depending on the nature of the
conflict, the circumstances, different modes are more appropriate. For
example, in an emergency situation where one person has to go to a
hospital, one would not attempt a collaborating mode of resolving a
conflict of who takes the taxi. In such situations, a competing mode
will be the most appropriate. In other situations, like trivial
conflicts, it may be the best strategy to avoid the conflict
altogether.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="safety-risk-and-the-public">Safety, Risk, and the Public</h4>
<p>In thinking about public safety and risk in professional practice, a
few points need to be born in mind. First, safety (both in terms of
workplace safety but also public safety) is a key responsibility
engineers need to take very seriously. Second, a way to consider safety
is to analyze the nature of risk that the public is exposed to from
particular products or processes. We will consider these aspects in more
detail below.</p>
<p><strong>Safety and Accidents</strong></p>
<p>Safety is a key responsibility for engineers, both in the workplace
as well as for the public. In an earlier lesson, we discussed the legal
implications of workplace safety. So we will only consider the
implications for public safety here. In thinking about public safety, an
engineer needs to bear in mind both product and process safety. Thus, it
is not enough to consider how safe products are, but also how safe
industrial processes are for the public. Issues of safety are
particularly important in the context of accidents. In the industrial
environment, accidents can be broadly categorized into three types:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Procedural accidents: Such accidents are attributed to operator
errors, the failures to follow regulations or standard operating
procedures.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Solution is to provide better operator training, supervision and
regulation.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Engineered accidents: Such accidents result from flaws in
engineering design or from sub-optimal performance.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Solution is to conduct better research and testing of materials and
designs.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Systemic accidents: These accidents are the ones that are least
diagnosable and predictable. These accidents are the result of
complexity and coupling between sub-systems that lead to unforeseen
accident pathways that can have catastrophic consequences.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Solution is to provide multiple redundancies to prevent cascading
failures in industrial systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>In trying to address these different kinds of accidents, one means
engineers have to improve safety is through design. Designing for safety
would require engineers to consider the following aspects. First, design
must comply with applicable legal standards, in other words, obey legal
requirements. Second, design must comply with accepted engineering
practice or keep up with the state of the art in knowledge and
practices. Third, research all possible alternative designs, including
discuss design strategies with other designers. And finally, foresee
possible uses and misuses especially in system design, and then create
redundancies or backups to address system deficiencies.</p>
<p><strong>Risk and Risk Communication</strong></p>
<p>Yet another way to address safety is by analyzing and communicating
the risk associated with a process or product. But what is risk? Risk
can be defined as the probability of an event occurring and of the
consequences of that event. Risk, therefore, combines the probability or
chance of an event occurring with the consequences of that event. Risk
assessment is the process by which the risk associated with a process or
product can be characterized. In other words, risk assessment is the
determination of quantitative value of risk related to a recognized
threat. There are several existing methods that attempt to model and
assess the risk associated with complex processes. Some examples of
existing methods include Failure Mode, Effects &amp; Criticality
Analysis (FMECA), Hazard Analysis &amp; Critical Control Points, and
Failure Tree Analysis. The objective of these methods is usually to
identify, model, and evaluate the unique inter-relationship of events
leading to failure or unintended events. The end goal of this process
being to understand the working of the system better in order to
neutralize known sources of risk. Risk neutralization can be defined as
the utilization of safety measures to reduce the danger potential of a
product or process. It must be born in mind, that while it is possible
to reduce risk, it is impossible for a product or process to have zero
risk. Zero risk does not exist.</p>
<p>Once an engineer has assessed the relevant risk, they need to realize
that communicating risks to the public requires a well thought out
strategy and it is not sufficient to tell the public about the risk
associated. One factor that needs to be considered in all efforts to
communicate risk is risk perception. Risk perception can be defined as
the degree of sentiment of danger among individuals who are exposed to
the source of risk. Given that the perception of risk is a sentiment or
feeling, it varies depending upon a host of non-technical factors, such
as whether the risk is well known, whether the consequences are
short-term or long-term, whether delayed or immediate, whether it is
fair or evenly distributed, whether exposure is voluntary or
involuntary, or whether there is real possibility of catastrophe. For
example, if people believe that they are involuntarily (or not of their
choosing) exposed to a risk, they perceive the risk to be higher.
Similarly, if the risk is a near-term risk, the public believes it is
higher. Again, if there is a possibility, however remote, of a
catastrophe associated with the process or product, the perception of
risk is always higher.</p>
<p>In this context, the goal of risk communication is to not only inform
people and to warn them of potential risks, but also foster trust in the
analysis/assessment of risk. With this goal in mind, risk communication
requires a well thought out strategy that must have the following
elements. Communication must be made by persons in charge and having the
authority to share information. All stakeholders affected must be
identified and their concerns addressed. Otherwise, it will result in
distrust; be honest in assessments but ensure that you do not add to
hysteria. Such risk communication is not only important at times of
crisis and emergencies, but more importantly to gain voluntary consent
of the public before introducing processes or products in society. A
good example where voluntary consent is needed to address risk
perception would be introducing cutting edge advances in technology,
such as nanotechnology devices or genetically modified organisms.
Voluntary consent by the public is an essential basis of liberal
democracy in a “risk society” – that is a society where products and
processes expose citizens to varying levels of risk. Such voluntary
consent requires engineers to provide or disclose information and then
obtain voluntary agreement from concerned stakeholders for introducing
new products or processes.</p>
